# Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR) Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Feature Completed

The React Black Player now has full **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)** support with automatic quality detection from HLS streams.

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Quality Detection**
- HLS streams are automatically parsed to extract all available quality levels
- Quality levels are displayed in Settings ‚Üí Quality menu
- Quality names are auto-generated based on resolution (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K)

### 2. **Seamless Quality Switching**
- Switch between quality levels without interrupting playback
- Supports both auto mode (ABR) and manual quality selection
- Works with both HLS streams and manual video sources

### 3. **Unified Quality Menu**
- Merges HLS-detected qualities with manually defined source qualities
- Displays all available options in a single, organized menu
- Maintains existing quality switching functionality for non-HLS sources

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. **`src/hooks/useHls.ts`**
   - Added `HlsQualityLevel` interface
   - Implemented quality level detection via `MANIFEST_PARSED` event
   - Added callbacks for quality levels loaded and level switching
   - Enhanced HLS.js configuration

2. **`src/hooks/usePlayerState.ts`**
   - Added state management for HLS quality levels
   - Merged HLS qualities with manual source qualities
   - Enhanced `handleQualityChange` to support both HLS and manual switching
   - Exported new state variables for quality management

3. **`src/components/ReactBlackPlayer/ReactBlackPlayer.tsx`**
   - Connected HLS quality callbacks to player state
   - Passed quality level handlers to useHls hook

## üîß Technical Details

### Quality Detection Flow
```
HLS Stream Loaded
    ‚Üì
MANIFEST_PARSED Event
    ‚Üì
Extract Quality Levels (height, width, bitrate)
    ‚Üì
Generate Quality Names (720p, 1080p, etc.)
    ‚Üì

    ‚Üì

```

### Quality Switching Logic
```typescript
// Auto mode (ABR enabled)
hls.currentLevel = -1;

// Manual mode (specific quality)
hls.currentLevel = levelIndex;
```

### Quality Level Interface
```typescript
interface HlsQualityLevel {
  height: number;      // Video height in pixels
  width: number;       // Video width in pixels
  bitrate: number;     // Bitrate in bits per second
  name: string;        // Generated name (e.g., "720p")
  level: number;       // HLS level index
}
```

## üìù Usage Example

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import { ReactBlackPlayer } from 'react-black-player';
import type { VideoSource } from 'react-black-player';

const MyPlayer = () => {
  const hlsSource: VideoSource[] = [
    {
      src: 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8',
      type: 'application/x-mpegURL',
      quality: 'auto',
      poster: 'https://image.mux.com/x36xhzz/thumbnail.jpg',
      aspectRatio: '16/9',
    },
  ];

  return (
    <ReactBlackPlayer
      sources={hlsSource}
      controls={{
        quality: true,  // Enable quality selector
        settings: true, // Enable settings menu
      }}
      onQualityChange={(quality) => {
        console.log('Quality changed to:', quality);
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## üé¨ Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5174`

### 3. Test Quality Switching
1. Click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the player controls
2. Navigate to the **Quality** section
3. You should see all available quality levels (auto, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
4. Try switching between different qualities
5. Notice seamless transitions without playback interruption
6. Select **"auto"** to enable adaptive bitrate streaming

### 4. Verify Console Output
Open browser console to see quality change events:
```
‚úÖ Quality changed to: 720p
‚úÖ Quality changed to: auto
```

## ‚ú® Key Features

## üîç How to Verify Implementation

### Check 1: Quality Levels Appear
- Load an HLS stream
- Open Settings ‚Üí Quality
- Verify multiple quality options are listed

### Check 2: Quality Switching Works
- Select a specific quality (e.g., 720p)
- Verify video switches to that quality
- Check console for quality change event

### Check 3: Auto Mode Works
- Select "auto" quality
- Player should automatically adjust quality based on bandwidth
- Quality may change during playback

### Check 4: Seamless Transitions
- Switch between qualities during playback
- Verify no buffering or interruption
- Playback position should be maintained

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Worker-based HLS parsing for better performance
- Efficient quality level caching
- Minimal re-renders on quality changes
- Smart quality name generation

### Best Practices
1. Use `quality: 'auto'` for optimal user experience
2. Provide poster images for faster perceived load time
3. Set `preload="metadata"` for faster initial load
4. Host streams on CDN for better performance

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Safari
- Uses native HLS support
- Limited programmatic control over quality levels
- Quality switching behavior may differ from Chrome/Firefox

### Network Conditions
- Auto mode requires stable connection
- Very poor connections may not support higher qualities
- Quality switches may be delayed on slow networks

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Bandwidth estimation display
- [ ] Quality change notifications/toasts
- [ ] Custom quality naming
- [ ] Quality level filtering options
- [ ] Advanced HLS.js configuration
- [ ] Quality statistics and analytics
- [ ] Preferred quality persistence
