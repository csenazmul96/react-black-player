# Keyboard Controls - React Black Player

## ✅ Fixed Keyboard Shortcuts

All keyboard controls are now fully functional:

| Key | Action | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **Space** | Play/Pause | ✅ Working |
| **Arrow Left** | Seek backward 10 seconds | ✅ Working |
| **Arrow Right** | Seek forward 10 seconds | ✅ Working |
| **Arrow Up** | Increase volume | ✅ Working |
| **Arrow Down** | Decrease volume | ✅ Working |
| **M** | Toggle mute | ✅ **FIXED** |
| **F** | Toggle fullscreen | ✅ **FIXED** |
| **Enter** | Enter fullscreen | ✅ Working |
| **Escape** | Exit fullscreen | ✅ Working |

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The M (mute) and F (fullscreen) keyboard shortcuts were not working.

### Solution
Updated the `useKeyboardControls` hook to:
1. Accept `toggleMute` and `toggleFullscreen` as optional parameters
2. Added `KeyM` case to handle mute toggle
3. Added `KeyF` case to handle fullscreen toggle
4. Updated the ReactBlackPlayer component to pass these functions to the hook

### Files Modified
1. **src/hooks/useKeyboardControls.ts**
   - Added `toggleMute` and `toggleFullscreen` parameters
   - Implemented `KeyM` handler for mute
   - Implemented `KeyF` handler for fullscreen
   - Updated dependency array

2. **src/components/ReactBlackPlayer/ReactBlackPlayer.tsx**
   - Passed `toggleMute` and `toggleFullscreen` to `useKeyboardControls`

## Testing

To test the keyboard controls:

1. **Start the demo**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open the player**: Visit http://localhost:5175
3. **Click on the player** to focus it
4. **Test each key**:
   - Press **Space** → Video should play/pause
   - Press **M** → Audio should mute/unmute
   - Press **F** → Player should enter/exit fullscreen
   - Press **Arrow keys** → Should seek and adjust volume

## Usage in Your Application

The keyboard controls work automatically when the player container is focused. No additional configuration needed:

```tsx
<ReactBlackPlayer 
  sources={sources}
  // Keyboard controls are enabled by default
/>
```

### Disabling Keyboard Controls

If you need to disable keyboard controls (not recommended), you would need to modify the component. By default, they enhance user experience.

## Notes

- Keyboard controls only work when the player container has focus
- Controls are disabled when typing in INPUT or TEXTAREA elements
- All shortcuts use `preventDefault()` to avoid browser default behaviors
- The container automatically receives `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard focus

## Build Status

✅ Package built successfully with keyboard controls fix
- Build output: `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.esm.js`
- All TypeScript checks passed
- Ready for production use
